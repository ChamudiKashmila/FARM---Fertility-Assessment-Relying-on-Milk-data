# Analysis of dairy cow milk composition correlation to fertility
#Abstract 

The reproductive health and milk productivity of a dairy cow are of high importance to dairy farmers in order for them to maintain an optimal herd size as well as milk production.  Both reproduction and lactation are affected by the overall health of an animal, from environmental factors to aging.  Milk composition has been utilized in prior work to identify disease processes in cows, and the link between health and fertility is well known.  Our team intends to use data on milk composition to inform forecasting on the future fertility of individual animals. 

We hope to use regression analysis, which is a fundamental concept in the field of machine learning, to predict the fertility of a dairy cow using milk composition.  Regression analysis falls under supervised learning where the algorithm is trained with both input features and output labels, which helps in establishing a relationship among the variables by estimating how one variable affects the other.  From the scientific perspective of this project, we will compare the hormone levels present in the milk, as well as fat and protein content of the milk, with other factors collected from the data, with the hopes of drawing conclusions about how the fertility of the cows could be affected based on any outside variables.
